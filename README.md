# A simple command line application that prints the time to the console using ASCII art characters; written in Rust.

* The only purpose of this project was to help me learn the basics of Rust.

* Special thanks to the members over in the [Rust live chat forum](https://client00.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust) for helping me through some Rust compiler errors.
