# TODO:

## Bugs:

## Features:
* Add any visual enhancements to the art

## Miscellaneous:
* **DOUBLE CHECK ALL CODE.**  I deleted a lot of items, make sure I didn't miss any code that can be deleted now.
* Refactor print_time_horizontally() if possible.
* Find a better way to print out the border without putting inside methods that aren't meant to print the border.
