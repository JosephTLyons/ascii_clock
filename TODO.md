# TODO:

## Bugs:

## Miscellaneous:
* Fix up date formatting to make it more visually pleasing.
* Refactor print_time_horizontally() if possible.
* Maybe create the time object in the main and pass it into both functions to keep from creating it twice?

## Features:
* Add decorations around the clock
* Make AM / PM an item that always prints, but uses an asterisk to indicate which day
